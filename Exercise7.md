# Exercise 7 - Project

Check out this Participatory Planning showcase project and try out the live demo (https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/showcase/participatory-planning/)

Start a new project and create your own city planning application

It's up to you what you implement and how you do it, but here are some suggestions
- Use the editor and/or the sketch widget
- Add an interface that let's you choose different types of roads, paths, trees, vehicles, etc to add
- Make use of the Esri web style symbols (https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/visualization/symbols-color-ramps/esri-web-style-symbols-3d/)
- Use the calcite components for your user interface
- If you're interested in how something is implemented in the Participatory Planning example, check out the code on GitHub

Not sure where to start? Start by adding a 3D scene and get the sketch widget working on the map. From there you can try changing up the symbology
