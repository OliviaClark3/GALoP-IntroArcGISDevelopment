# Exercise 6 - You're on your own

Congrats on making it through all the structured exercises. You must be getting the hang of this by now.

Here some tasks for you to try without me providing the help guides, you can find the documentation on your own.

 - Add the Expand Widget to each of your over widgets so they don't have to all block the screen

 - Add a header to your website above the map with the title of your application using a div. Make it so that there is no scrollbar on your page by changing the styles

 - Take a look through the JavaScript SDK documentation to find another widget you want to add to your map, and add it in
