# Exercise 2 - Display a map

To use the JavaScript SDK, we'll need an API key to confirm that we have the licence to use it

1. Follow this link (https://developers.arcgis.com/dashboard/) to go to your developer dashboard

    a. If prompted with a question about how you use ArcGIS, you can answer the question or just Return to Dashboard

If you already have an API key, skip to step 4

2. In the top right, click API Keys, then click New API Key
3. Give it any title you like, then click Create API Key. Keep this tab open in your browser as you will need to use your API key shortly

We will now add a map to our website

4. Remove the My Website text from the viewDiv in the body of the HTML

5. Follow the instructions at (https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/tutorials/display-a-map/) to display a map.
When asked for your API Key, copy and paste in the one you just generated

NOTE: We already have some of the code shown in this tutorial. Start off at the heading Add Modules

6. Save your work, and reload your website
