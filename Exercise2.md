# Exercise 2 - Display a map

To use the JavaScript SDK, we'll need an API key to confirm that we have the licence to use it.

1. Go to the content tab in your GALoP ArcGIS Online
   
3. Go to "New item" in the top left corner, then Developer Credentials
   
5. Select "API key credential" and click Next
   
7. Click Next on the Settings page
   
9. On the Privleges page, enable everything then click Next

If you are creating an application for your work or organisation, you may wish to read up on these privleges and only enable certain ones, but for the purpose of our exercises today, we will just keep everything enabled.

6. Click Next on the Restrict item access page
   
8. Add a title in the item details and click Next
   
10. Click the checkbox and click Next on the Summary page
    
12. Click next to generate your API key now

You will then be presented with your API key. Be sure to make a copy of this and store it somewhere safe. Once you close this window you will no longer have access to the API key and will have to make a new one if you lose it.

We will now add a map to our website

1. Remove the My Website text from the viewDiv in the body of the HTML

2. Follow the instructions at (https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/tutorials/display-a-map/) to display a map on your website.
When asked for your API Key, copy and paste in the one you just generated

NOTE: We already have some of the code shown in this tutorial. Start off at the heading Add Modules

3. Save your work, and reload your website
